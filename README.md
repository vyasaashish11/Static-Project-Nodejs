# Project 6: Static Node.js and Express Site 

* Note please reject submission if it doesn't meet all requirements for exceeds expectations!

* The goal of this project was to learn server-side JavaScript, with us having to independently:
    * Create a portfolio site to showcase the projects we've worked on in the course
    * Create a JSON file to store all the data about the projects we've created
    * Use Pug to complete provided templates that utilise the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser
    * Use Node.js and Express to:
        * Import the required depdendencies
        * Link the JSON with the Pug templates
        * Set up routes to handle requests
        * Set up the middleware to utilise static files like CSS
        * Handle errors
        * Set up a server to serve the project
